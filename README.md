# language-syntax-settings

This package extends atom's native settings with language-dependant settings applied when you switch files.

Usage:
 - start typing `language settings` in your command palette (`cmd+shift+p`), you'll see a list of grammars which settings you can edit
 - `language settings: current` command detects syntax used in the current file and opens it for edition
 - you can also access it from the menu: `packages->language settings`

Settings are stored in `~/.atom/language-settings/<grammar>.cson` files.

Please note: it's an early release, may be considered unstable.
